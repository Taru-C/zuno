    <p>AI-Powered Accessibility App for Inclusive Classrooms</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Millions of students in India with visual, hearing, or learning disabilities are excluded from classrooms — not because of inability, but due to inaccessible teaching methods and lack of adaptive tools. Visually impaired students struggle with printed text and slides; hearing-impaired students miss spoken lessons; and students with dyslexia face difficulty with standard fonts. Teachers, though willing, lack simple, affordable, offline solutions in regional languages. This results in low participation, higher dropout rates, and limited educational inclusion.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Solution — Zuno</h2>
    <p>Zuno is an AI-powered accessibility app that transforms classroom content into inclusive formats using Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Speech, OCR, and translation technologies. It enables students with visual, hearing, and learning disabilities to learn, listen, and participate equally in any classroom. Built on open-source AI models like Whisper, Coqui TTS, ML Kit OCR, and IndicTrans2, Zuno supports 22+ Indian languages and works offline on low-cost Android devices.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Unique Value Proposition</h2>
    <p>A unified, low-cost, offline-first platform for multiple disabilities — unlike existing global tools that are costly, online-only, and support just one disability type. Zuno is tailored for Indian classrooms, offering regional language support, offline accessibility, and open-source affordability.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Market Opportunity</h2>
    <p>India has 24.3 million students with disabilities (PwD) requiring adaptive educational tools (UDISE 2021-22). The Indian EdTech market is projected to reach ₹2.5 lakh crore by 2030, with the assistive technology segment growing at 23.5% CAGR. Zuno targets 200,000 active users in Tier 2/3 cities within 3 years through partnerships with NGOs and education boards.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>Innovation & Impact</h2>
    <p>Zuno bridges the digital accessibility gap with AI-driven inclusivity. It reduces dropout rates, enhances comprehension, and empowers differently-abled students to learn independently. Teachers gain a simplified dashboard for content accessibility, and schools save costs by using a single adaptive solution. Aligned with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and NSS goals, Zuno promotes ‘Education through Service’ by enabling college volunteers to assist inclusive learning in government schools.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>What Makes Zuno Distinct</h2>
    <p>Zuno combines affordability, regional accessibility, and AI inclusivity — offering a multilingual, offline, open-source platform that serves students with multiple disabilities. At ₹7K–₹9K per school per year, Zuno is 10× cheaper than global alternatives and designed specifically for India’s diverse learning ecosystem.</p>
